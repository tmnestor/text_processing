# Search Patterns Configuration
# ------------------------------
# This YAML file defines patterns for categorizing sentences in a pandas DataFrame.
# Each entry consists of a named dictionary with inclusion and optional exclusion rules.
#
# Structure:
# - pattern_name:
#     include:
#       - "phrase1"
#       - "phrase2"
#     exclude:
#       - "excluded_phrase1"
#       - "excluded_phrase2"
#
# Rules:
# 1. Each pattern must have at least one inclusion rule.
# 2. Exclusion rules are optional.
# 3. Patterns are applied in the order they appear in this file.
# 4. The first matching pattern (inclusion matches & exclusion doesn't) will be applied.
# 5. If no patterns match, the original sentence is kept unchanged.
#
# Note: All matches are case-insensitive.
